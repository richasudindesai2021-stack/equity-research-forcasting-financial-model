# **Apex Solutions Inc. – Integrated Three-Statement Financial Model (5-Year Forecast)**

This repository contains a fully integrated three-statement financial model for Apex Solutions Inc., built using a professional investment-analyst workflow. The model delivers a 5-year forward forecast, incorporating segment-level revenue drivers, detailed cost structures, working capital schedules, capital expenditure planning, and a full debt and interest schedule.

The objective of this project was to replicate the analytical process used by Equity Research Analysts, translating qualitative management commentary and MD&A insights into a fully linked, quantitative financial forecast, and evaluating the company’s forward-looking financial health.

## 📈 Modeling Approach

The model follows a top-down, driver-based forecasting methodology, aligned with equity research and investment banking best practices.

### 1. Revenue Forecasting

Segment-level revenue build for Software, Hardware, and IT Services

Growth rates derived directly from management guidance

Software: 20%

Hardware: 18%

IT Services: 16%

Forecast incorporates:

Market penetration assumptions

Subscription-based revenue scaling

Hardware demand cycles

IT services expansion and industry outperformance

### 2. Cost Structure & Margin Forecasting

Segment-specific COGS percentages maintained per management guidance

Gross margin modeled bottom-up by business segment

SG&A fixed at 15% of revenue, reflecting operating leverage and disciplined cost control

Clear flow-through into EBITDA and operating margins

### 3. Depreciation & Capital Expenditures

Explicit CapEx projections for each forecast year ($10B → $15B)

Depreciation modeled as a percentage of revenue and linked to the PP&E roll-forward

Ensures accurate integration into:

EBITDA

EBIT

Operating and investing cash flows

### 4. Working Capital Forecasting

Working capital components driven by turnover-based assumptions

Receivables: 19 days

Inventory: 70 days

Payables: 48 days

Changes in working capital flow directly into Operating Cash Flow

Enables analysis of cash conversion efficiency and liquidity discipline

### 5. Debt Schedule & Interest Flow-Through

Annual term-loan repayment of $2B

Annual debt issuance of $1B

Interest expense calculated using average outstanding debt at a fixed 9% rate

Interest income modeled at 3% on cash balances

Ensures accurate forecasting of:

EBT

Net Income

Cash balances

### 6. Fully Integrated Financial Statements

Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement fully linked

Ending cash from the Cash Flow Statement ties directly to the Balance Sheet

Balance Sheet balances automatically through:

Retained earnings

Cash and debt adjustments

## 🔍 Analytical Outputs

The model enables detailed analysis of:

Segment-level revenue growth trajectories

Margin expansion and operating leverage

Cash flow generation and conversion efficiency

Leverage trends and debt sustainability

Liquidity management and working capital discipline

Long-term profitability and return characteristics

This mirrors the analytical lens applied in sell-side equity research, investment banking, and private equity.
